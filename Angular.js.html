<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS is a very popular MVW (Model/View/Whatever)
framework maintained by Google. AngularJS enables web
developers to impose MVC structures on their client-side
code and to build dynamic web applications more easily.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS introduces component-based architecture. It also
includes a variety of conventions that developers should
know and use, which will be presented in this Refcard.
AngularJS includes a wide range of features that help to build
Single Page Applications (SPAs) faster and is considered a
“one-stop shop” for creating SPAs. Another good aspect of
AngularJS is that it was written with testability in mind.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">You will learn that AngularJS is expressive, readable,
extensible, and quick to develop. All of these qualities
make AngularJS one of the best JavaScript frameworks for
application development</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">In this Refcard, you will get to know the essential parts of
AngularJS. The Refcard will also try to help you speed up your
development process when you use AngularJS. </span>

<div class="title strong"><span id="toBuilding">A ngularJS Building Blocks</span></div>

<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS includes a few building blocks that you should
know and understand:</span>
<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>Version</th><th>Implementations</th></tr><tr><td>Modules</td><td>Logical containers for different parts of AngularJS objects</td></tr><tr><td>Controllers</td><td>A constructor functions that are used to hold scopes and expose behaviors that views can use</td></tr><tr><td>Scopes</td><td>Objects that reference the application model</td></tr><tr><td>Views</td><td>HTML that presents the models and interacts with the user</td></tr><tr><td>Templates</td><td>HTML that contains AngularJS-specific elements and attributes</td></tr><tr><td>Services</td><td>Objects that enable you to organize and share code in an AngularJS application</td></tr><tr><td>Filters</td><td>Transform the model data to an appropriate representation in the view</td></tr><tr><td>Directives</td><td>Reusable web components that tell the AngularJS HTML compiler how to render them and how the components behave.

Injection</td><td>Design pattern that deals with how to
inject dependencies to a dependent object.
AngularJS uses this pattern and enables you
to inject dependencies in a declarative way.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<img src="img/module.png"alt="622">
<br><span class="move_left">The following diagram shows how these building blocks work
together to build the AngularJS ecosystem:</span>
<br><span class="move_left">Let’s explore how some of these parts relate to the MVC
design pattern:</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">The Model </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">The model is the data structure that holds some business data. It
will usually reside from the server side using a REST API or from
a service. The model is exposed to the AngularJS view using the
$scope object. </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">The View</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">The view is the HTML part that presents the data structure and
enables user interactions. The view binds to a model using the
$scope object. It can call controller functions through the $scope
object as well. It uses filters to transform the model data to an
appropriate representation. It also uses directives as reusable web
components and for DOM manipulation.</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">The Controller</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">The controller performs all the business logic and orchestrates
operations. It is responsible for initializing the $scope, can
interact with AngularJS services, and exposes functions to the
view using the $scope object. The controller is also responsible
for updating the model based on user’s view interactions. </span>

<div class="title strong"><span id="toSetting">Setting up the Environment</span></div>

<br><span class="move_left">The first thing that you will need to do is set up the environment.
AngularJS can be downloaded from <a href="www.angularjs.org">www.angularjs.org</a> and
included in your web page or it can be included directly from the
Google Content Delivery Network (CDN):</span>
<div class="commands"><pre><script src=”https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
angularjs/1.2.9/angular.min.js”></script></pre></div>
<br><span class="move_left">Another option is to install AngularJS using your favorite package
manager and then include its script. For example, you can use
Bower to install AngularJS using the following syntax:</span>
<div class="commands"><pre>bower install angular</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">A third option is to clone the GitHub angular-seed repository.
Angular-seed is an application skeleton for the AngularJS web
application. </span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">Once AngularJS is installed in your web application, you can start
working with it.</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">The ng-app Directive</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">One of the most important AngularJS directives is the ng-app
directive. ng-app bootstraps the application, and instructs
AngularJS to load the main module that is given as the directive
parameter. The next code example shows how to setup the ngapp
directive to the myApp module:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><!doctype html>
<html ng-app=”myApp”>
<head>
<script src=”https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
angularjs/1.2.9/angular.min.js”></script>
</head>
<body>
<div>
</div>
</body>
</html></pre></div>
<div class="title strong"><span id="toBootstrap">A ngularJS Bootstrap</span></div>
<br><span class="move_left">Once the browser loads a web page and it includes the
AngularJS script along with the ng-app directive, AngularJS
is bootstrapping. There are two options for bootstrapping:
automatic bootstrap and manual bootstrap. Let’s explore both of
these options</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Automatic Bootstrap</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Three main things happen when AngularJS is automatically
bootstrapping. First, AngularJS creates an injector object, which
will be used later on for dependency injection. Then, AngularJS
creates the root scope, which is the root for all the scopes in the
application. Finally, AngularJS compiles the Document Object
Model (DOM) starting from the ng-app directive, compiling
and processing all the directives and bindings that it finds in the
DOM.</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">The following diagram shows the process:</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Manual Bootstrap</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Sometimes you want to perform operations before AngularJS
starts. These operations can be configurations, retrieving relevant
data or anything else you might think about. AngularJS enables
you to manual bootstrap the application. You will need to remove
the ng-app directive from the HTML and use the angular.
bootstrap function instead. Pay attention, as you will need to
declare your modules before using them in the angular.bootstrap
function. Manual AngularJS bootstrapping is not so common.
Now that we know about how to start an AngularJS application,
let’s explore the first AngularJS building block – modules.</span>

<div class="title strong"><span id="toModules">modules</span></div>
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">What is a Module?</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS modules are logical containers for different parts of
AngularJS objects. AngularJS applications are typically created
with one or more modules. Modules can have dependencies on
other modules. These dependencies are resolved automatically by
AngularJS when a module is loaded into memory. </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Creating a Module</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">You create modules using the angular.module function. Each
created module should have a unique name that is passed as
the first argument to the angular.module function. The second
angular.module argument is an array of dependencies, which can
have zero to many dependencies. Here is an example of using the
angular.module function to declare a myApp module, which is
dependent on a storageService:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>angular.module(‘myApp’, [‘storageService’]);</pre></div>
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Configuring a Module</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">You can add module configuration using the config function once
you declare a module. The configuration will get executed when
the module is loading. You can inject providers or constants
(which will be discussed later in the Refcard) to the configuration
block you are writing. Here is an example of a call for the config
function:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>angular.module(‘myApp’, [‘storageService’])
.config(function ($provide, $filterProvider) {
$provide.value(‘myValue’, 1);
$filterProvider.register(‘myFilter’, ...);
});</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">In the previous code, there are two injectable objects - $provide
and $filterProvider. In the config function body, we create a
constant value called myValue, which is set to 1. We also register
a filter called myFilter into the $filterProvider. </span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">Another option to interact with an AngularJS module execution
is to use the run function. The run function runs after all the
modules have been loaded. The function is used to literally run
the AngularJS application. You can inject services and constants
into the run function callback. The following code shows how to
use the run function:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>angular.module(‘myApp’, [‘storageService’])
.run(function (someInstance) {
someInstance.doSomething();
});</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">Now that we understand how to create and use modules, let’s
explore the AngularJS dependency injection (DI) mechanism.</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">AngularJS Dependency Injection</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Each AngularJS application includes an $injector object. The
$injector is responsible for dependency management and for
dependency lookups. Here is a diagram that shows how DI works
in AngularJS:</span>

<br><span class="move_left">Let’s analyze what is going on in the diagram. Once the root
module is created, AngularJS will create a new $injector object.
While the application is running, a lot of objects such as
controllers, services, and filters are registered in the $injector
container. Later on, if an object has a dependency, AngularJS
will use the $injector object to search it. If an instance of the
dependency is available, it is returned by the $injector. If there is
no instance of the dependency, a new object is created using the
$injector instance factory. The new object is returned and also
stored in the instance cache.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">Some of the main AngularJS objects such as modules, controllers,
and services can declare that they need a dependency. In order to
do that, you need to add function arguments with the exact name
of the dependency. That means that if you have an object named
obj and you want to inject it, you will have to have a function
argument in the AngularJS object with the same name. Here is a
controller example that declares it needs a $scope injected object:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>var myApp = angular.module(‘myApp’,[]);
myApp.controller(‘MyController ‘, function($scope) {
});</pre></div>
<br><span class="move_left">You can see the use of explicit DI syntax [‘$scope’,
function($scope) {}] which helps to avoid minification issues.
This is the preferred way to use DI in AngularJS, and in the code
example we use it to create a controller. Speaking of controllers,
let’s explore what these AngularJS objects are.</span>
<div class="title strong"><span id="toControllers">Controllers</span></div>
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">What is a Controller?</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS controllers are just JavaScript constructor functions
that are used to hold scopes and to expose behaviors that views
can use. You can think about controllers as the logic behind the
view. Each controller has a new child scope that is available as the
$scope argument in the constructor function. When a controller
is created during runtime, the $injector will inject the $scope
argument. Controllers add properties and functions to the $scope. </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Creating a Controller</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">In order to create a controller, all you need to do is to declare
a constructor function. The following code shows a simple
controller:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>var myApp = angular.module(‘myApp’,[]);
myApp.controller(‘MyController’, [‘$scope’,
function($scope) {
}]);</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">The way to wire a controller constructor function to a view is
using the ng-controller directive:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><div ng-controller=”MyController”>
</div></pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left"> A few notes about controller best practices:</span>

<ol class="disc"><span class=" strong font_size"></span><li>Controllers should contain only business logic that relates to the view that they are bound to.</li><li>Business logic that isn’t related to the controller bound view should be injected into controllers as services.</li><li>Don’t use controllers for DOM manipulation, formatting, or filtering. We will discuss the ways to do those operations later in the Refcard.</li></ol>

<br><span class="move_left">Now that you are familiar with controllers, let’s talk about scopes. </span>

<div class="title strong"><span>scopes</span></div>
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">What is a scope?</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Scopes are objects that include properties and the functions set by
controllers that a view can later use. You can think about scopes
as the glue between a controller and a single view.</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Once a controller is attached to a view using the ng-controller
directive, all the scope properties and functions are data bound
to the view, and it can use them. Changes to scope properties
are reflected in the bounded view and user interactions can also
change the bound properties. </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">What is the digest cycle?</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">The digest cycle in AngularJS is code that runs in intervals and
its main idea is to enable data binding. Its purpose is to observe
model mutations (using $watch API) and to propagate any model
changes (using $apply API).</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">The next diagram shows what the digest cycle in AngularJS looks
like:</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Using Scopes in Code</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS runtime injects a scope object into a controller, and
then the controller can set the $scope with properties and
behaviors. The following example shows how to add a property
called message and a function called myFunc to a scope object:</span>
<div class="commands"><pre>var myApp = angular.module(‘myApp’,[]);
myApp.controller(‘MyController ‘, function($scope) {
$scope.message = ‘hello’;
$scope.myFunc = function() {
// do something
}
});</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">You can also put full model objects inside scope properties that
can later be used by a view.</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">The $rootScope</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">All AngularJS scopes inherit their functionality from the
$rootScope. Every AngularJS application has a single $rootScope.
The $rootScope includes several utility functions that you can use
which are also available on its child scopes such as $new, $watch,
and $destroy. You can find more details about these functions in
the AngularJS documentation.</span>

<div class="title strong"><span>View</span></div>

<br><span class="move_left">A view is dynamic HTML that presents models and interacts with
the user. AngularJS views can be bound to a controller using the
ng-controller directive. Once a binding is set, you can use scope
properties and functions in the view. In order to harness the full
potential of views, you should understand two AngularJS concepts
that relate to views: templates and expressions. </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">templates</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">A template is a declarative specification that contains HTML
parts. It also contains AngularJS specific elements and attributes
that are called directives and AngularJS expressions. The
directives “explain” to AngularJS how to transform the template
into a dynamic view. The expressions are placeholders that are
used for data binding. The following example shows a template:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><div ng-controller=”MyController”>
<input ng-model=”message”>
<button ng-click=”changeMessage()”>{{btnTe
xt}}</button>
</div></pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Expressions</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">In the previous template example you can see that we used curly
brackets to wrap btnText. This is an example of an expression.
Expressions are JavaScript code used for binding. Expressions
are placed in double curly brackets. When AngularJS processes a
template, it searches for expressions, then parses and evaluates
them. The evaluation of expressions is being done against
the controller scope object. If the scope doesn’t contain the
expression value, AngularJS will not throw an exception. This
behavior enables you to perform lazy binding.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">The following code example shows a simple expression that
evaluates to 5:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><div> 3+2={{3+2}} </div></pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS expressions don’t have access to global variables and
can only use scope-exposed functionality. Expressions can’t use
control flow statements except from the ternary operator (a ? b :
c). </span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">In AngularJS 1.3 you can also use expressions for one-time
binding. Any expression that starts with :: will evaluate only once.
The following code example shows you how to use one-time
binding on a message property:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><div>
One-time binding: {{::message}}
</div></pre></div>
<div class="title strong"><span>Services</span></div>
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">What is a Service? </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Services in AngularJS are singleton objects that are used to
perform a specific task. Services are UI independent, meaning
that they shouldn’t manipulate or use UI elements (this is the
role of view and directives). You can inject services to modules,
controllers, filters, directives, and more. </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Creating a Custom Service</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">There are four options for service creation in AngularJS:</span>

<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>Service Type</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>value</td><td>Use the module’s value function with a given name and value. The injector will return the exact value.</td></tr><tr><td>factory</td><td>Use the module’s factory function with a given name and a factory function. The injector will invoke the given function.</td></tr><tr><td>service</td><td>Use the module’s service function with a given name and constructor function. The injector will use the new keyword to create the service single instance</td></tr><tr><td>provider</td><td>Use the module’s provider function with a given name and provider function. The injector will invoke the provider’s $get function.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<br><span class="move_left">Here are usage examples for the first three options:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>var myApp = angular.module(‘myApp’,[]);
myApp.value(‘myValue’, ‘a constant value);
myApp.factory(‘myFactory’, function(name) {
return ‘Hi ‘ + name;
}
myApp.service(‘myFactory’, function(name) {
return ‘Hi ‘ + name;
}</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">When you want to use the previous services you will inject them
to a dependent object by their name and use them. For example,
here is a controller that uses the previous services:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>myApp.controller(‘myController’, function($scope,
myValue, myFactory) {
$scope.value = myValue;
$scope.greet = myFactory;
}); </pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Built-in AngularJS Services </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS comes with several built-in services. Here are the
descriptions of some of them:</span>

<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>Built-in Service</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>$http</td><td>Used for communicating over HTTP with remote servers. The service receives as argument a configuration object for configuring the HTTP request.</td></tr><tr><td>$resource</td><td>Abstraction on top of $http for interaction with REST services. Require a dependency on ngResource module. Exposes functions such as get, save and delete.</td></tr><tr><td>$q</td><td>Exposes the ability to create promises (deferred objects) for cleaner design of asynchronous code.</td></tr><tr><td>$log</td><td>Enable to log messages</td></tr><tr><td>$location</td><td>Includes the current parsed URL. Changes to $location are reflected to the browser address bar.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<br><span class="move_left">There are many other services such as $animate, $window,
$rootScope, $interval, and $document You can read about those
services in the AngularJS documentation:<a href="https://docs.angularjs. org/api/ng/service">https://docs.angularjs.
org/api/ng/service</a>.</span>
<div class="title strong"><span>Filters</span></div>
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">What is a Filter?</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Filters format an evaluated expression value to an appropriate
representation in the view. When you want to use a filter you just
“pipe” it using the “|” sign to the expression like in the following
code example:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>{{ message | filter }}</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">For example, if you want to use a currency filter with a number
value you just state the name of the filter:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>{{ 5 | currency }}</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">The output of the expression will be 5$. </span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">Filters can have arguments using the semicolon sign, and they
can be chainable. On the other hand, filters shouldn’t depend on
global state and should be stateless. </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Creating a Custom Filter</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">You can create your custom filters in two ways: using
the module’s filter function or registering a filter in the
$filterProvider service. The first argument that a filter receives in
its callback function is the input value. All the other arguments
are considered additional arguments, which can be used by the
filter function.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">The following example shows how to register a filter that turns
any string to its upper case representation:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>var myApp = angular.module(‘myApp’,[]);
myApp.filter(‘uppercase’, function() {
return function(str) {
return (text || ‘’).toUpperCase();
};
}</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Built-in AngularJS Filters</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS comes with a set of built-in filters that you can use.
Here are their descriptions:</span>

<br><span class="move_left"></span>
<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>Built-in Filter</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>currency</td><td>Used to format numbers as currency</td></tr><tr><td>date</td><td>Used to format dates as string</td></tr><tr><td>number</td><td>Used to format numbers as string</td></tr><tr><td>json</td><td>Converts JavaScript object to its string representation</td></tr><tr><td>lowercase</td><td>Transforms the given string into its lowercase representation</td></tr><tr><td>uppercase</td><td>Transforms the given string into its uppercase representation</td></tr><tr><td>limitTo</td><td>Creates a new array or string according to the specified number of elements</td></tr><tr><td>orderBy</td><td>Orders a given array by a given expression predicate</td></tr><tr><td>filter</td><td>Selects a subset of items form the given array</td></tr></tbody></table>
<div class="title strong"><span>Directives</span></div>

<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">What is a Directive?</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Directives are one of the most powerful features in AngularJS.
Directives are custom HTML elements and attributes that AngularJS
recognizes as part of its ecosystem. Directives allow you to extend
the existing HTML with your own elements or attributes and to add
behavior to existing elements or attributes. You already saw a few of
the AngularJS built-in directives such as ng-app and ng-controller</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">When an AngularJS bootstrap runs, the AngularJS’s HTML compiler
($compile) is attaching a specified behavior to DOM elements
according to directives. The process is done in two phases: compile
and link. The compiler is traversing on the DOM and collects all
the directives. The linker combines directives with their scope and
produces a dynamic view. </span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Creating a Custom Directive</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">Like controllers, services, and filters, directives are also
registered to modules. In order to register a directive, you will
use the module’s directive function, which receives a directive
name and a factory function. The factory function should return
a directive definition object. The following example will create a
bare directive with the name myDirective:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>var myApp = angular.module(‘myApp’,[]);
myApp.directive(‘myDirective’, function() {
return {
};
});</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">The returned directive definition object can include various
configuration options.</span>

<table class="syntax_description"><tbody>
<tr><th>Directive Configuration</th><th>Description</th>
</tr><tr><td>restrict</td><td>By default directives are restricted to attributes. Using restrict you can restrict the directive to A (attribute), E (element), C (class) and M (comment)</td>
</tr><tr><td>template</td>
<td>Appends a given HTML as the child element of the element</td>
</tr><tr><td>replace</td><td>If set to true will replace the entire element with a given template (used with the template or templateUrl configurations)</td></tr><tr><td>templateUrl</td><td>A URL for a given template that would be
loaded and appended to the element</td>
</tr><tr><td>scope</td><td>By default, directive has the scope of its parent controller. If Scope is set to {}, an isolated scope is created for the directive, You can map and bind parent properties to an isolated scope using @ (one directional mapping), = (bidirectional mapping), and & (executes an expression in the parent scope)</td>
</tr><tr><td>link</td>
<td>If set to true, the directive can wrap content. In the template of the directive you need to use the ng-transclude directive in order to mark the place to wrap content</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<br><span class="move_left">The following code example shows a simple directive declaration:</span>
<div class="commands"><pre>myApp.directive(‘myDialog’, function() {
return {
restrict: ‘EA’,
scope: {},
template: ‘<div class=”dialog”>{{message}}</div>’,
link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
scope.message = ‘hello’;
}
};
});</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">When you want to use this directive you can write in your HTML:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><my-dialog></my-dialog></pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">or:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><div my-dialog></div></pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Built-in Useful Directives</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS includes many built-in and useful directives that you
can use. </span>

<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>Built-in Directive</th>
<th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>ngModel</td><td>Binds an HTML element to a property in the scope</td></tr>
<tr><td>ngEventName (replace EventName with any DOM event)</td>
<td>These directives enable you to add custom behavior on the specified event</td></tr><tr><td>ngValue</td>
<td>Binds a given expression to a value of an input. When the input changes the bound model (which is the ngModel) changes as well</td>
</tr><tr><td>ngBind</td><td>Binds an expression to the text content of a HTML element. When the expression changes the text, content changes as well</td></tr><tr><td>ngClass</td>
<td>Retrieves an external HTML fragments,
compile it and add it to the DOM  </td></tr>
<tr><td>ngInclude</td>
<td>Dynamically sets CSS classes on HTML elements by evaluating the given expression</td></tr><tr><td>ngRepeat</td><td>Collection iterator. In each item in the
collection, the template that is bound to the
directive is instantiated with its own scope </td></tr>
<tr><td>ngShow</td>
<td>Shows or hides an HTML element according to the evaluated expression</td>
</tr><tr><td>ngSwitch</td>
<td>Enables to create DOM evaluation
conditions like a switch case statement</td></tr></tbody></table>
<br><span class="move_left">You can find more built-in directives in the following AngularJS
documentation: <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive</a>.</span>
<div class="title strong"><span>A ngularJS and Forms</span></div>

<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS adds two way binding, state management, and
validation to HTML forms. You can bind HTML input types to
models using the ngModel directive and AngularJS will provide all
the mechanisms. </span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">When AngularJS locates form elements in the DOM, it will make
them available as a property of the scope. The name of the
property will be the name of the form. Each input type in the
form will be a sub-property of the scope form property</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">Form Validation Directives</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS provides a few built-in validation directives which can
set the form validation $error property. The available directives
are:</span>

<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>Validation Directive</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>required</td><td>A required field</td></tr><tr><td>min</td><td>Validates the value is greater than the minimum value</td></tr><tr><td>max</td><td>Validates the value is less than the maximum value</td></tr><tr><td>minlength</td><td>Validates the value has length bigger than the provided minimum</td></tr><tr><td>maxlength</td><td>Validates the value has length smaller than the provided maximum</td></tr><tr><td>pattern</td><td>Validates the value against a given regular expression</td></tr></tbody></table>

<br><span class="move_left">Here is an example of using form validation with AngularJS:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><form name=”myForm”>
<div>
<input type=”text” name=”username” ngmodel=”user.name”
required/>
</div>
<div>
<input type=”password” name=”password” ngmodel=”user.password”
required />
</div>
<button ng-click=”login(user)”>
Login
</button>
</form></pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">In this form, the scope will have a property with the name
myForm that will be bound to the form. The myForm property
will include the username and password sub-properties, which
will include references to the input types. If the user name and
password isn’t supplied, the $error of the form will be set to an
error and the form wouldn’t submit.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS also decorates form elements and input types with CSS
classes. You can use those classes to change the presented style
of an element according to its state. The CSS classes that you can
use are:</span>

<ol class="disc"><span class=" strong font_size"></span><li>ng-valid</li><li>ng-invalid</li><li>ng-invalid-[validation name]</li><li>ng-pristine</li><li>ng-dirty</li></ol>

<div class="title strong"><span>Routing</span></div>

<br><span class="move_left">One of the most important mechanisms in Single Page
Applications (SPA) is client-side routing. Client-side routing
enables developers to intercept route changes and instead of
rendering a new page in the server, render a document fragment
in the client and replace a shell element. This is how you move
from one page to another in SPAs. AngularJS provides a routing
feature that can be used to create this behavior to inject views
into an ngView decorated element.</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left strong font_size">The ngRoute Module</span>
<br class="cbt">
<br><span class="move_left">The ngRoute module is a router module for AngularJS (it isn’t
built-in to AngularJS). There are other options (such as uirouter),
which are also very commonly used. In order to use a
module, you will have to reference the angular-route script and
add ngRoute as a dependency of your ngApp module.</span>

<div class="commands"><pre><script src=”angular-route.js”></script>
var myApp = angular.module(‘myApp’, [‘ngRoute’]);</pre></div>

<br><span class="move_left">In order to register routes, you use the $routeProvider service.
The $routeProvider service provides a when function to register
routes and a default route that is set using the otherwise function.
Each registered route includes a path and a configuration object. </span>

<br><span class="move_left">The configuration object includes the following main
configurations:</span>

<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>Route Configuration Option</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>template/ templateUrl</td><td>The path/template string that represents the template that is going to be attached to an ngView</td></tr><tr><td>controller</td><td>The controller that is bound to the template’s scope</td></tr><tr><td>redirectTo</td><td>Name of the route to redirect to when you want to redirect to a different route</td></tr></tbody></table>

<br><span class="move_left">Here is an example:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>myApp.config(function($routeProvider) {
$routeProvider
.when(‘/about’, {
templateUrl: ‘views/about.html’,
controller: ‘myController’
}).when(‘/cart’, {
templateUrl: ‘views/cart.html’
}).otherwise({
templateUrl: ‘views/home.html’,
controller: ‘myController’
});
});</pre></div>
